"""
script that adds command-line arguments to a Python list and
saves them to a file:
"""
import sys
from os import path
from save_to_json_file import save_to_json_file
from load_from_json_file import load_from_json_file


filename = "add_item.json"
"""
# Write a class Student that defines a student by:
# VARIABLE(" "):
# To JSON(self): Student to JSON
# Return: Always 0. (Success)
"""
"""
The script starts by importing the sys module for accessing command-line
arguments and the path module from the os package for working with file paths.
"""
"""
The save_to_json_file function from the 5-save_to_json_file.py module and the
load_from_json_file function from the 6-load_from_json_file.py module
are imported.
"""
# Check if the file exists
if path.exists(filename):
    # Load the existing list from the file
    my_list = load_from_json_file(filename)
else:
    # Create an empty list if the file doesn't exist
    my_list = []

# Add the command-line arguments to the list
my_list.extend(sys.argv[1:])

# Save the updated list to the file
save_to_json_file(my_list, filename)
"""
The variable filename is set to "add_item.json", which represents the name of
the file to save the list. The script checks if the file exists using the
path.exists() function. If the file exists, the existing list is loaded from
the file using the load_from_json_file function. If the file doesn't exist,
an empty list is created. The command-line arguments are obtained using
sys.argv[1:], which excludes the script name itself (sys.argv[0]). These
arguments are added to the list using the extend() method. The updated list
is then saved to the file using the save_to_json_file function.
